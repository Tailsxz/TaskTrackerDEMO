### Optimizations

### Knowledge gained from this project
Learned how absolutely great Vite is for a simple SPA! Honestly amazed at this build tool.
Further solidified React fundamentals and the flow of a React app.
Learned how to produce a production build and preview it.
Learned how to set up a mock backend using json-server for component testing/prototyping.
Got experiencing setting up HTTP requests to a backend in React(Note:Its very similar to vanilla JavaScript so if you know how to do it in regular JS, its relatively simple to implement in a React App).
Learned how to apply Client Side Routing with react-router-dom(Note: Router must wrap the main app in which we define a Routes element(required!!) specifying the specific routes we want with the individual Route elements inside the Routes element). Now instead of having a component or render attribute as in the guide, we now have the element attribute which we embed JSX using the curly brace syntax to set the markup to render for that route. ex) element={<>{some JSX here}</>}
Learned how to utilize the Link element that is provided with React Router. Will rerender the UI when navigating to a route rather than forcing a full page refresh as with the anchor tag.
