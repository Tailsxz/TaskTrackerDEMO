### Optimizations

### Knowledge gained from this project
Learned how absolutely great Vite is for a simple SPA! Honestly amazed at this build tool.
Further solidified React fundamentals and the flow of a React app.
Learned how to produce a production build and preview it.
Learned how to set up a mock backend using json-server for component testing/prototyping.
Got experiencing setting up HTTP requests to a backend in React(Note:Its very similar to vanilla JavaScript so if you know how to do it in regular JS, its relatively simple to implement in a React App).
